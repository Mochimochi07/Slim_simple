# Slim_simple

i tried slim because of Golang.
its very clse to Gin and its really Gin actually.
the only problem that you might face is just the downloading and installation.
if you wanna install you might going to consider installing all of them manually.
you might need to download tons of middlewares to use micro frameworks.
microservices are good and are blazingly fast.
they're really secure and they make developers lives productive like putting a coin to a piggy bank and imagining what you can achieve.
yeah having microservice architecture than monollithic will save the enerfy.

Well...its time to try other languages and frameworks.
